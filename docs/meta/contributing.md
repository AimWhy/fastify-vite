# Contributing

Despite having received a handful of code contributions already, <b>fastify-vite</b> is still very much an individual endeavor. It very much welcomes contributors interested in helping with:

- Readding a test suite (check the old one [here](https://github.com/terixjs/fastify-vite/blob/b6a894df77af1fde88826c235e97d692e84426e8/example/test.js))
- [Renderer adapters](/internals/renderer-api.html) for <b>Vue 2</b>, <b>Preact</b>, <b>Svelte</b> and <b>SolidJS</b>
- Documentation refinements and more boilerplate flavors.
- Improving the development process as described below

## Running examples in development

This is perhaps an obvious area of improvement â€” in order to test the packages, you must call `npm run devinstall` from each example directory root <b>after every change</b>.

For instance, if you make changes to `packages/fastify-vite` and `packages/fastify-vite-vue`, you'll want to run `npm run devinstall` from `examples/base-vue` to test your changes.

 The reason for this is that there were some issues encountered trying to use `npm link` for this that couldn't be sorted out at the time. So for the time being development of this project relies on [devinstall.mjs](https://github.com/terixjs/fastify-vite/blob/main/devinstall.mjs), which will actually copy each package to the example's `node_modules` folder.
