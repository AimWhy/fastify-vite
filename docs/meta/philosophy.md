# Philosophy

The <b>vision</b> behind this plugin is that <b>[Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)</b> and <b>[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)</b> are a solid basis to build fast and maintainable applications with ease and elegance, providing only the absolutely necessary at a time.

This is a matter of principle, that is, **striving to write software with the least amount of hidden and unnecessary complexity**. In concrete terms, for instance, the <b>node_modules</b> directory size for basic <b>fastify-vite</b> projects is much smaller than their equivalents in Nuxt.js or Next.js. 

You can expand your application's capabilities by adding more Fastify plugins or Vite plugins as necessary, instead of starting out with every single battery included.
