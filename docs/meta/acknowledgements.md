# Acknowledgements

It's funny to think that six years ago I was still primarily a backend Python developer with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) occupying my time more than with anything frontend related. I would have never imagined back then one day I'd be using JavaScript for all my backend needs too. [How things change](https://hire.jonasgalvez.com.br/2017/aug/25/leaving-python-for-javascript/).

This project wouldn't have come to existence without all the inspiring work of the teams behind [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) and [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js). They set the standard for the new age of SSR frameworks. It just happened that they grew so big that I started wanting to have a lighter, smaller option for some projects.

In particular, I am honored to have had the chance to collaborate with [Pim](https://github.com/pimlie), [Pooya Parsa](https://twitter.com/_pi0_?lang=en) and [SÃ©bastien Chopin](https://twitter.com/Atinux) when I was part of [Nuxt's core team](https://nuxtjs.org/teams/).

The work of [Matteo Colina](https://twitter.com/matteocollina) and [Tomas Della Vedova](https://twitter.com/delvedor?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) is also a big reference and source of inspiration in my journey in the pursuit of writing modern, performance standard JavaScript code. 

Another big source of inspiration is [Anthony Fu](https://antfu.me/). His creativity, style and precision are truly remarkable. This documentation suite started out based on his [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) template for [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/).
