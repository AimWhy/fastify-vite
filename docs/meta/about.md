# About 

Created by [Jonas Galvez](h), a former [Flash and ActionScript book author](https://www.google.com/search?q=jonas+galvez+flash+actionscript&tbm=isch) (yep), former [Python developer](https://pypi.org/project/xmlwitch/), and more recently, former [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) <b>core team member</b> and author of several Nuxt.js [articles](https://www.google.com/search?q=jonas+galvez+nuxt) and [modules](https://github.com/galvez?tab=repositories&q=nuxt). Also holder of the #1 Google result for [leaving Python for JavaScript](https://www.google.com/search?q=leaving+python+for+javascript). _Giggles_.

The <b>vision</b> behind this plugin is that <b>[Fastify]()</b> and <b>[Vite]()</b> are a solid basis to build fast and maintainable applications with ease and elegance, providing only the absolutely necessary at a time.

This is a matter of principle, that is, **striving to write software with the least amount of hidden and unnecessary complexity**. In concrete terms, for instance, the <b>node_modules</b> directory size for basic <b>fastify-vite</b> projects is much smaller than their equivalents in Nuxt.js or Next.js. 

You can expand your application's capabilities by adding more Fastify plugins or Vite plugins as necessary, instead of starting out with every single battery included.

**Terix** is the <b>_parent project_</b> of <b>fastify-vite</b>, encompassing all other necessary Fastify plugins and libraries to make this vision possible.
