## Acknowledgements

Big shout out to [NearForm](http://nearform.com/) for lending this project the amazing [Paul Isache](https://twitter.com/paul_isache), who helped get the first iterations of React [renderer adapter](https://fastify-vite.dev/internals/renderer-api.html) working.

This project wouldn't have come to existence without all the inspiring work of the teams behind [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) and [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js). They set the bar high for SSR frameworks.

In particular, I am grateful to have had the chance to collaborate with [Pim](https://github.com/pimlie), [Pooya Parsa](https://twitter.com/_pi0_?lang=en), [Clark Du](https://twitter.com/ClarkDu_), [Alexander Lichter](https://github.com/manniL), [Dmitry Molotkov](https://github.com/aldarund), [Kevin Marrec](https://github.com/kevinmarrec), [Alexandre Chopin](https://twitter.com/iamnuxt?lang=en) and [SÃ©bastien Chopin](https://twitter.com/Atinux) when I was part of the Nuxt.js core team.

The work of [Matteo Colina](https://twitter.com/matteocollina) and [Tomas Della Vedova](https://twitter.com/delvedor?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) is also a big reference and source of inspiration in my journey in the pursuit of writing modern, performant standard JavaScript code. 

Another big source of inspiration is [Anthony Fu](https://antfu.me/). His creativity, style and precision are truly remarkable. This documentation suite started out based on his [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) template for [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/).
