# Known Limitations

- It's currently impossible to run **`@fastify/vite`** in an encapsulated Fastify plugin. You'll need to register **`@fastify/vite`** at the root context, or if you want to use it in a plugin, that plugin must be wrapped in [`fastify-plugin`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-plugin) so it's also registered at the root context.
  > Investigation on this has started but is still pending â€” everything points to **`@fastify/middie`**, the Express compatibility layer needed to run the Vite development server middleware. It's just considered low-prio at the moment as in most setups, only a single instance is needed anyway.

- It's currently impossible to run **multiple** Vite development server middleware in your Fastify server, which means `@fastify/vite` can **only be registered once**. Configuration for this is somewhat tricky and there isn't documentation on how to do it. Once [#108](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-vite/pull/108) is completed and merged, it will open the path to have a Vite development server factory that can create instances on-demand, but that approach still remains to be tested.
